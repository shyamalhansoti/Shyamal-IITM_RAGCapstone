W3 contract preserved:

  POST /ask_batched   — returns Answer JSONawait asyncio.sleep(settings.retry_delay_s * (2 ** attempt))
  GET  /health        — {"status": "ok"}

W4 changes to the BODY (not the contract):
  • ask_llm now uses tool-calling → richer Answer (confidence, sources,
    schema_version) and real cost_usd.
  • /ask now streams REAL OpenAI chunks (not asyncio.sleep simulation).
  • Each /ask_batched call is persisted to SQLite with model + cost_usd.

Old clients see additive fields in the JSON response; they keep working.
